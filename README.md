# ten90

Packaging the guts of [dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090)
into a library.  Actually I started with [MacolmRobb's
fork](github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090) which has many new features.

## Building

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
```

## Run unit tests

```bash
$ make check
```

## Run the dump1090 executable

```bash
$ ./dump1090
```
